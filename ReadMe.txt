I feel that I have accomplished what I set out to do. I feel that I made the story very interesting. Although I do feel that I should’ve added more puzzles so that it would give the player a challenge when he or she came up to it.

One time I got stuck was when I was trying to figure out how to make a combination puzzle. I had a hard time trying to put the dial on the door. I was helped by Cole Damon, who had a similar puzzle in his mini game. He then showed me how to put the dial on the door and how make a 4 digit combination in which the player had to spin in order to unlock the door.

My three puzzles were interacting with a NPC in order to gain information about the story. My second puzzle was where the player had to find 4 digit combination code to spin into the dial on the door in order to unlock the door so he or she can pass to the next room. My final puzzle was a combining puzzle, where the player had to find two separate parts and combine them together to make a sledgehammer.

I feel that a good game mechanic that showed throughout my game was that is was very interactive. There was a lot of things that the player had to do in oder to complete the the story, from interacting with NPCs, making a sledgehammer, and spinning a 4 digit code to open a door.

Jaryd Ma beta tested my game. By watching him play I was able to find many errors in my game, such as grammar mistakes and undescribed items. He also gave me some ideas on that I should add more dialogue between the player and the NPC. 

I tested Jaryd Ma’s game and really enjoyed it. I really like the way he put out his puzzles and his story in general. Some feed back I gave him was mostly grammar mistakes and undescribed items.

I am most proud of learning how to make a combination puzzle.

I think the next time I would add more NPCs so the player can have different dialogues with many different people.
